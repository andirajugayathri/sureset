                <h2>9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

                <h2>10. Miscellaneous</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in
                    full force. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive it. These Terms constitute the entire
